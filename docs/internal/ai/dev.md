# Technical Development Guide

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10.0.26100
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **IDE**: Cursor
- **Working Directory**: `c:\docs\projects\apps\design2`

## Rules Configuration
- **Main config**: `.cursorrules` (root directory)
- **Rules directory**: `.cursor/rules/`
- **Format**: Markdown (.md) files
- **Structure**: Modular rules system

## Project Architecture
*To be defined as the project develops*

## Code Organization
*To be established based on chosen technology stack*

## Development Patterns
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Using Cursor AI with custom rules
- **Documentation-Driven**: All changes documented in real-time
- **Quality-First**: Enforced code quality standards
- **Factorization-Focused**: Continuous refactoring to eliminate duplication

## Development Workflow
1. **Before Implementation**: Search for similar existing code
2. **During Development**: Follow naming conventions and quality standards
3. **After Implementation**: Review for refactoring opportunities
4. **Documentation**: Update project and technical documentation

## AI Assistant Rules
The project uses a comprehensive set of AI assistant rules:

### Mandatory Project Rules (`mandatory-project-rules.mdc`)
- Date handling
- Conversation logging
- Command execution logging
- Project documentation maintenance

### Code Quality Standards (`code-quality-standards.mdc`)
- Naming conventions
- Code duplication prevention
- Code similarity detection and refactoring
- Analysis and research requirements
- Standards compliance
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Testing
- Performance optimization

## Development Setup
*To be documented when technology stack is selected*

## API Documentation
*To be added when APIs are implemented*

## Performance Considerations
*To be documented based on project requirements*

## Security Considerations
*To be documented based on project requirements*

## Testing Strategy
*To be established when testing framework is selected*
