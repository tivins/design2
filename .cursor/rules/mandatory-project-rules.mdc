# Mandatory Project Rules

## Date Rule
- When it is necessary to obtain the current date, use the command `date`.

## Conversation Logging Rule (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: Always save our conversation in a markdown file located at 'docs/internal/ai/chat/<date>-subject.md'.
- **File naming format**: YYYY-MM-DD-subject-description.md
- **Required content**: Conversation summary, actions performed, decisions made
- **Timing**: Create the file at the beginning of each new conversation
- **Verification**: Always check that the docs/internal/ai/chat/ directory exists before creating the file
- **NEW CONVERSATION RULE**: If the subject changes or a new conversation starts, create a NEW file with a NEW name
- **File uniqueness**: Each conversation must have its own unique file - never append to existing conversation files
- **Subject identification**: Use descriptive subject names that clearly identify the conversation topic

## Command Execution Logging Rule (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: Document ALL terminal commands executed during the conversation
- **Required documentation**: 
  - Command executed (exact syntax)
  - Purpose/explanation of the command
  - Exit code and output (if relevant)
  - Any errors encountered
- **Location**: Include command logs in the conversation markdown file
- **Format**: Use code blocks with command explanations
- **Timing**: Log commands immediately after execution

## Project Documentation Rule (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: Maintain comprehensive project documentation
- **Global project view**: Keep `docs/internal/ai/project.md` updated with:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Architecture and structure
  - Key features and components
  - Dependencies and technologies
  - Current status and roadmap
- **Technical project view**: Keep `docs/internal/ai/dev.md` updated with:
  - Technical architecture details
  - Development setup and environment
  - Code organization and patterns
  - API documentation and interfaces
  - Performance considerations and optimizations
- **Update frequency**: Update documentation whenever significant changes occur
- **Verification**: Always check that documentation files exist and are current

## Project Wording and Branding Rule (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: Use centralized wording and branding guidelines
- **Wording file**: All URLs, names, descriptions, and copy must be defined in `docs/internal/ai/wording.md`
- **Brand consistency**: Follow the established brand voice, tone, and terminology
- **URL management**: All URLs and links must be referenced from the wording file
- **Copy standards**: Use standardized phrases, button labels, and messages
- **Update process**: Update wording file before implementing new copy or changing existing text
- **Verification**: Always check wording file before creating new user-facing text

## Automatic Reminder
- These rules must be applied to EVERY conversation, without exception
- If the log file doesn't exist, it's an error that must be corrected immediately
- All terminal commands must be documented for full traceability
