# Cursor AI Rules Configuration

This project uses a modular rules system for AI-assisted development with Cursor.

## Rule Files Structure

- **mandatory-project-rules.md**: Core mandatory rules for all projects
- **code-quality-standards.md**: Code quality and development standards
- **naming-conventions.md**: Comprehensive naming conventions guide

## Rule Application

All rules are automatically applied to every conversation and code modification.

## Template Usage

This is a template project structure that can be adapted for different types of projects:
- Web applications
- Mobile applications  
- APIs and microservices
- Desktop applications
- Libraries and packages

## Quick Start

1. Copy this `.cursor/rules/` directory to your new project
2. Update `docs/internal/ai/wording.md` with your project details
3. Adapt the rules to your specific technology stack
4. Update `docs/internal/ai/project.md` and `dev.md` with your project information

## Rule Categories

### Mandatory Rules (Always Applied)
- Date handling
- Conversation logging
- Command execution logging
- Project documentation
- Wording and branding
- Testing and validation
- Self-compliance

### Quality Standards (Applied During Development)
- Naming conventions
- Code duplication prevention
- Code similarity detection
- Analysis and research
- Standards compliance
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Performance optimization

## Customization

Rules can be customized per project by:
1. Modifying the specific rule files
2. Adding project-specific rules
3. Disabling certain rules if not applicable
4. Adding technology-specific conventions
